# Make Me A Gif!

This is a crude script intended mainly to turn a video captured using Quicktime's Record Screen function and turn it into a gif (allowing for aspect-ratio retaining downscaling).

## Requirements

You must have ffmpeg and gifsicle installed

    $ brew install ffmpeg
    $ brew install gifsicle


## Usage

    Usage: make-me-a-gif [options]
        -p, --path [PATH]                Path to the .mov file
        -g, --gif-path [PATH]            Full path to save the gif to, including file name. (Defaults to the same file name/directory with a .gif extension)
        -s, --scale [SCALE]              How to scale the movie down.  A value of 2 would scale a 400x300 video to 200x150. (Defaults to 2)
